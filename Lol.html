    <p id="Fourth">A song that holds a deeper meaning than what meets the eye. Where an English song collaborates with Crunchyroll, created this masterpiece and an official short film with a girl called Rin. The film shows a 17-year-old Rin who lives in a virtual reality where whatever she puts on her canvas turns into reality. She soon discovers a glitch that shows her simulation which soon leads to her discovering her past in this virtual simulation that is filled with loneliness. The lyrics of the song are English, no matter how much the Japanese-styled animation is. It is both bittersweet, as Rin, the main character, would realize about her past and come into a realization. This song radiates both the sadness about not being able to have their missing someone in the video, but also has comforting lyrics about acceptance and hope.</p>

  <p id="Second">This is a beautiful love song where the singer won't leave their special someone behind, and will always stay with her. Yet this beautiful masterpiece in the 1900s is soon known to be a top internet meme, with over 1 billion views on YouTube, whether for pranks, accidental, or on purpose. Either way, countless remakes, covers, and remixes were made after this popular song, and it is now waiting to see if another new viewer would one day, stumble upon this song, and let him show off a famous intro beat and chorus, as well as a famous bright, transitioning outdoor and indoor environment. Of course, when peeking into the heartwarming lyrics, a man who sang and created will never leave the special someone he loved. He would never give them up.</p>
