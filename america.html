  <p id="First">Love You For All Time</p>
  
  <p id="Second">Love You For All Time is a song from Gareth Emery, who features Annabel as the vocalist. The song represents the fleeting time of reality, and how a singer tries her best to remember the small moment she had with her loved ones but can't. But even so, she would love and cherish what they had. The music video hit the hardest and prepared to shed some tears, with a heart-wrenching bond of family love between the people. It is one of the most bittersweet songs, and it teaches us to enjoy and cherish the precious moments before they fade away for good. Out of every English song I ever had, this hits the hardest into my soul, with the gentle voice of Annabel, with a music video and message that resonates with my inner soul, it tells me how much I love my family and would do anything to cherish them.</p>

  <p id="Third">Woman, Amen</p>

    <p id="Fourth">Woman, Amen is a song by Dierks Bentley. It was originally introduced to me through a radio during our car ride. It's a country song that heavily relates to Christianity, yet no matter how much our religion differs, the song radiates gratefulness towards the certain someone you have in your life. It tells a girl who gave the singer a home, comfort, acceptance, patience, healing, and more. The guitar and drums further emphasize the feeling of intensity as the lyrics say "I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs, Thank God for this woman, Amen". It taught me how to appreciate my loved ones, as the one who accepts the most is the ones are always the ones who stay with you the longest. Thus, as I listened to this over and over again, I thought of MY own special woman I have in my life- my mom.</p>
