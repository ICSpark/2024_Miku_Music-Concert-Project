  <p id="Credit">I want to credit everyone involved in the ICSpark for their time, patience, education, budget, planning, and encouragement for this project. Without them, this wouldn't be possible. I want to thank their effort to make this public program free and enjoyable to even a beginner like me. I did enjoy doing this project, and I never knew coding would be as fun. I was slightly discouraged whenever I thought that coding could be tedious, but with enough time and effort, I could enjoy the small progress slowly building up on top of one another. From the bottom of my heart....thank you!</p>
