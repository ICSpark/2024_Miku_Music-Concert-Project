  <p id="First">回る空うさぎ</p>
  
<p id="Second">回る空うさぎ (Mawaru Sora Usagi) is a Japanese song created by Orangestar, covered by 初音ミク (Hatsune Miku). The song roughly translates to "Spinning Sky Rabbit". It is a song about someone who wants to reach her goal (the moon) yet fails to reach it. It is a beautiful song about perseverance, portrayed by the beautiful piano that increases in intensity to empathize with the sensation further. The song was inspired by the Asian folklore of "The Moon Rabbit" or "Jade Rabbit". Listening to the song while understanding the lyrics makes you want to adore the night even more. This became my top favorite song of all time as I too, adore the night.</p>

  <p id="Third">ブッ飛んでラニカイ</p>
  
  <p id="Fourth">ブッ飛んでラニカイ (Buttonde Lanikai) is an original song by a Japanese Nijisanji VTuber, 樋口楓 (Higuchi Kaede). It is said that she traveled to America, specifically here in Lanikai, O'ahu, and created the song that centered around her experience in the beauty of Hawai'i as well as the fun of overall traveling. Her bright, energetic, somewhat tomboy personality fits into the playfulness of the song, as she is willing to experience something new and exciting. The song is from the opening of the Japanese drama, 量産型リコ (Ryosangata Riko). The fact that it perfectly represents the beauty of Hawai'i is no doubt my favorite song I have. She also participated in another opening of this drama with an original song called "ビュティーMYジンセイ!" (Beauty MY Jinsei)(Roughly translates to "Beauty MY Life").</p>
